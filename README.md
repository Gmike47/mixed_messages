# mixed_messages
a Codecademy message generator project

### summary
At first I did an if else if function to pop up squirel facts,
but then I changed it to a more randomly changing sentence in order for the project to appear not entirly bare bones.
I made lists to hold values to be randomly selected and then called upon them, randomly.
The sentence has some RPG, DnD vibe, at least for me, I hope you sense it too (even though it's very smol).
